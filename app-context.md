# Insurance Monitoring Dashboard: Project Summary

## Project Overview
We've developed a monitoring dashboard for insurance submission intake and compliance monitoring. The application provides real-time visibility into submission status, compliance checks, and audit trails to ensure proper underwriting governance.

## Key Features
1. **Dashboard View**
   - Metrics cards showing submission counts and statuses
   - Audit control status visualization with pie chart
   - Compliance alerts section
   - Recent submissions table with filtering and sorting

2. **Submission Detail View**
   - Header with submission metadata and status indicators
   - Tab navigation (Overview, Documents, Compliance, Audit Trail, Actions)
   - Two-column layout for submission data and compliance status
   - Visual compliance indicators with drill-down capability

3. **Documents View**
   - Grid/thumbnail view of submission documents
   - Split-screen document viewer with extracted data
   - Document metadata and status indicators

4. **Compliance View**
   - Detailed findings for each compliance check
   - Data points used in evaluation
   - Override options with justification fields

## UI/UX Design
- Dark sidebar with green accent colors (matching ArtifiData brand)
- Clean, modern Material UI components
- Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes
- Visual status indicators (color-coded chips)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Framework
- React with TypeScript
- Material UI for components
- Redux for state management

### Data Flow
- Demo Mode: Uses synthetic data from mockData.ts
- Live Mode: Connects to external API with configurable mapping

### Integration Points
The system includes a configuration utility that allows mapping between the API's data structure and the application's internal data model, enabling flexibility when connecting to different backend systems.

### Key Data Models
1. **SubmissionData**: Core submission info (ID, insured, broker, coverage, etc.)
2. **ComplianceCheckResult**: Results of compliance checks with findings
3. **Document**: Document metadata and processing status

## Current State and Challenges
The application is functional but had several TypeScript and ESLint issues that we've addressed:
1. Material UI v5 compatibility issues with Grid and ListItem components
2. Type safety improvements for component props
3. Unused imports and variables

We've implemented a design that matches the ArtifiData brand with dark sidebar, green accents, and a professional enterprise look and feel.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete API integration** for live mode functionality
2. **Enhance visualizations** in the dashboard with more metrics
3. **Add user authorization** flow
4. **Implement filtering and searching** in submission lists
5. **Add export functionality** for reports
6. **Create additional views** for later stages in the policy lifecycle
